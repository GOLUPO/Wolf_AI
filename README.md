# Wolf_AI

Wolf_AI is an application that allows users to interact with an AI assistant, save and manage chats, and customize their user profile with updatable images and credentials. The application uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 optimized models to generate responses and chat names.

## Features

- **Registration and Login:** Users can register and log in using a username and password.
- **Dashboard:** Users can view and update their credentials, update their profile picture, and view saved chats.
- **Chat with AI:** Users can create new chats, send messages to the AI assistant, and receive responses generated by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 optimized models.
- **Chat Saving:** Chats are saved and can be reloaded later.
- **Chat Name Generation:** The chat name is automatically generated after the user's second message using the GPT-4 optimized mini model.
- **Profile Picture Management:** Users can upload and update their profile picture.
